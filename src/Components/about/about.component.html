                    Hi, I'm Emirhan Has覺rc覺, a dedicated fourth-year Computer Engineering student with a profound passion for software technologies, which I've been cultivating since 2018. Currently, I'm pursuing my degree at Bart覺n University and actively honing my skills in full-stack and indie game development during my free time.
                </p>
                <p>In my recent role as the Founder Lead of Google Developer Student Clubs (GDSC) Bart覺n, I established and led a
                    community dedicated to Google developer technologies. This experience enhanced my collaborative and leadership
                    abilities, providing a platform for knowledge exchange among aspiring professionals.</p>

            <p>I recently graduated from the Game and Application Academy, where I gained practical experience and valuable insights in game development and application design.</p>
            <p>I have experience with languages like C#, Java, JavaScript, and TypeScript, and I use frameworks like .NET and Angular to bring my ideas to life.
        
                Eager to contribute to the tech industry's innovation, I am open to exciting opportunities aligning with my
                expertise. Let's connect and explore ways to collaborate on meaningful projects.</p>
